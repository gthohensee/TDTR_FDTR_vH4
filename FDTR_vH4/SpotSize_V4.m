%The main program tries to minimize "Z" by optimizing the variable(s) X
%This program Lets you:
%   1) Define the vector X: example, if lambda(3) is what you want to solve for,
%   then set X=lambda(3)....if you whish to simulatenous solve for more than one
%   variable, you can just define multiple variables (eg. X(1)=lambda(3), X(2)=lambda(4))
%
%   2) Define the fit.  Typically, this is the sum of the squares of the
%   residuals, but you might want to weight these by the sensitivity,
%   particularly if you don't intend to calculate the errorbars!

%Define the variables to be fit
w0 = X(1);
if length(X) < 3

    mid = 0;
else
    A = X(2);
    mid = X(3);
